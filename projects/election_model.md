This was my attempt at creating my own Presidential election model. I scraped RCP using Selenium, with the simulation being a state-level Monte Carlo election forecast.

In the end, I ended up with a model that produced estimates in line with the mainstream betting markets and models, and accurately predicted the vote share in 6 of 7 swing states.
