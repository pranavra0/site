This was for my software engineering capstone project. I was frustrated with how overkill Kubernetes felt for smaller projects, so I decided to attempt to make my own orchestrator. 

It was definitely much harder than I initially assumed, but it illustrates how orchestrators work and serves as a solid system for very small-scale projects.
