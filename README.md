# Pranav Rao's Personal Website

This is the source code for my personal portfolio website, built with [Lume](https://lume.land/) and Deno.

## Development

To run the website locally:

1.  Install [Deno](https://deno.land/manual/getting_started/installation).
2.  Clone the repository.
3.  Run the following command:

```
deno task serve
```

The website will be available at `http://localhost:3000`.

## Building

To build the website for production, run:

```
deno task build
```

The static files will be generated in the `_site` directory.
